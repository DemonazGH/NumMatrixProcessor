Graduate projects contain core topics for this track. You need to apply core topics in project stages to verify your knowledge. 
At least one graduate project is required to complete the track.
Hereâ€™s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant,
and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in 
your notebook.

Recursive functions on stages 5 and 6 (determinant and inverse matrix) are not mine. Taken from Internet and adopted to my project.
